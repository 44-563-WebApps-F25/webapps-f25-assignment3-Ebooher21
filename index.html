        <h2>Dexter</h2>
        <p>
            On my last assignment, I said that Breaking Bad was my favorite show.
            I would say it still is, but I've recently started watching Dexter and I'm really enjoying it.
            I think the main reason I like the show so much is due to <b>how the main character is portrayed</b>.
            He is a serial killer that is living a normal life and only "takes care" of bad people.
            I like psychology so it's fun to see how the writers of the show <b>gave a serial killer a moral compass</b>
            and <b>construct</b> what <b>his daily life</b> involves.
