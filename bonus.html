        <h3>Ecstatic Beaver and Ella</h3>
        <p>
            For my adjective, I chose Ecstatic because the first letter of my first name is 'E'.<br>
            For my mammal, I chose Beaver because the first letter of my last name is 'B'.<br>
            Lastly, I chose the name Ella because the first letter is the same as the first letter in my first name.<br>
