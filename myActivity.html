            I would say my favorite outdoor activity would have to be fishing. 
            I don't do it often, but the reason I enjoy it so much is because it's relaxing. 
            You sit or stand in nice weather and enjoy the scenary. 
            It's usually quiet so you just here whatever is happening around you, seperated from society. 
            It's also fun to see what you've caught.
