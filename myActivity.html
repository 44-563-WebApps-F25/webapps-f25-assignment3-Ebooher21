            I would say my favorite outdoor activity would have to be fishing.<br>
            I don't do it often, but the reason I enjoy it so much is because it's relaxing.<br>
            You sit or stand in nice weather and enjoy the scenery.<br>
            It's usually quiet so you just hear whatever is happening around you, seperated from society.<br>
            It's also fun to see what you've caught.<br>
